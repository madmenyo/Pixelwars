# PixelWars

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) March 2023 Game Jam Entry for the Pixel Wars theme.

The idea was to create a ...IO game but just with AI bots (like most of 'm actually are). So a battle royal feeling with paintguns having to paint these "pixels". I started off with this forest as a placeholder and tried thinking of something more fitting of the theme but since time was of essence I never got to changing it. As of now I would love to improve the AI somehwat (doesn't attack the player and doesnt dodge bullets yet). Also some additional power ups or secundary weapons/items would make this game a lot more finished. But I still have to build the thing for GWT, fingers crossed to have some time left.

Scope bit me in the arse halfway trough the week so had to hack in a lot of stuff to get some results.
